Limon

## Description

Imagine you have all these amazing movies on your machine but your media player of choice leaves things to be aesthetically desired? Enter Limon. An application which crawls through your local directories to find all the MP4 hidden away on your machine, queries the OMDb API for movie information, dynamically creates an interface which allows you to view movie information and the movie's poster, and allows you to watch the movie in Firefox. Think Netflix, but for your personal machine.
